                <p>I made this timeline as supporting research for this essay: <a href="https://jasmi.news/p/agi" target="_blank">AGI (disambiguation)</a>. Excerpted:</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <p>This is a timeline of how visions of AGI and powerful AI have shifted over the past ~75 years, from the fathers of computing to today's frontier labs.</p>
                    
                    <p>On net, definitions have inched toward the measurable, practical, and achievable; emphasizing an AI's performanceâ€”especially vis-a-vis human benchmarks, on human jobsâ€”over internal "consciousness" or "agency," recursive self-improvement, or the ability to generalize to any new task or environment.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ultimately, AGI is better understood through the lens of faith, field-building, and ingroup signaling than as a concrete technical milestone. AGI represents an ambition and an aspiration; a Schelling point, a shibboleth. The AGI-pilled share the belief that we will soon build machines more capable than ourselvesâ€”that humans won't retain our hegemony on intelligence for long. The specifics aren't important: it's a feeling of existential weight.</p>
